In a vote in the early Wednesday morning hours, the Senate approved the final version
of the first overhaul of the US tax code in more than 30 years, handing
President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans their most significant
legislative victory of 2017.
The bill passed along party lines, 51-48 with the final result announced by
Vice President Mike Pence who presided over the vote. Sen. Jeff Flake,
the last undeclared Republican, voted yes.

The House passed the bill earlier Tuesday, but technical changes were made to it
in the Senate, and the bill will go back to the House on Wednesday for a revote,
where it is expected to pass again. It will then head to the President's desk
for his signature before the Christmas holiday, making good on the
Republican Party's promise to enact tax relief by the end of the year.</textarea> <br/><br/>
