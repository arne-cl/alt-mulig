# Remove line-clamp-1 class.

## You
I need a Tampermonkey userscript that works on the site `https://www.perplexity.ai` .
It should remove the `line-clamp-1` class from any `<div>` element.

For example, this:

```
<div class="inline line-clamp-1 grow default font-sans text-xs font-medium text-textMain dark:text-textMainDark selection:bg-super selection:text-white dark:selection:bg-opacity-50 selection:bg-opacity-70">BIOS Settings to Allow PXE Boot on Dell Latitude Laptops</div>
```

should be converted into that:

```
<div class="inline grow default font-sans text-xs font-medium text-textMain dark:text-textMainDark selection:bg-super selection:text-white dark:selection:bg-opacity-50 selection:bg-opacity-70">BIOS Settings to Allow PXE Boot on Dell Latitude Laptops</div>
```

Attached you will find a search results page from `https://www.perplexity.ai`.

## ChatGPT
Understood. I will create a Tampermonkey userscript that removes the `line-clamp-1` class from any `<div>` elements on the site `https://www.perplexity.ai`. Here's the script:

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Remove line-clamp-1 class from div elements on perplexity.ai
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      0.1
// @description  Removes the line-clamp-1 class from div elements
// @author       You
// @match        https://www.perplexity.ai/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    // Function to remove a specific class from all div elements
    function removeClassFromDivs(className) {
        const divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
        for (let i = 0; i < divs.length; i++) {
            divs[i].classList.remove(className);
        }
    }

    // Remove the line-clamp-1 class from all div elements
    removeClassFromDivs('line-clamp-1');
})();

```

Please let me know if you need help with anything else.

## You
The page will update whenever a user runs a new search. Unlike Google, new results will be appended to the site, so we'll have to watch for new `<div>` elements. Also, I would like to make this more efficient. `removeClassFromDivs` should not iterate over all `<div>` elements, but only those that have the class 'line-clamp-1'. Please check the attached HTML file to see which CSS selector or XPATH would be appropriate as a filter.

## ChatGPT
Looking at the `<div>` elements with the class `line-clamp-1`, there doesn't seem to be a unique parent or attribute that would allow us to narrow down the selection using CSS selectors or XPath. However, we can use the method `getElementsByClassName` in JavaScript to select only those `<div>` elements that have the `line-clamp-1` class, making the script more efficient.

Regarding the dynamic nature of the website where new results are appended, we can use a `MutationObserver` to monitor changes in the DOM and apply the class removal whenever new nodes are added.

Here's the updated userscript:

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Remove line-clamp-1 class from div elements on perplexity.ai
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      0.1
// @description  Removes the line-clamp-1 class from div elements
// @author       You
// @match        https://www.perplexity.ai/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    // Function to remove a specific class from divs with that class
    function removeClassFromDivs(className) {
        const divs = document.getElementsByClassName(className);
        while (divs[0]) {
            divs[0].classList.remove(className);
        }
    }

    // Remove the line-clamp-1 class from all divs initially
    removeClassFromDivs('line-clamp-1');

    // Create a mutation observer to watch for changes in the DOM
    const observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations) {
        // If new nodes are added
        if (mutations.some(mutation => mutation.addedNodes.length > 0)) {
            // Remove the line-clamp-1 class from new divs
            removeClassFromDivs('line-clamp-1');
        }
    });

    // Start observing the document with the configured parameters
    observer.observe(document, { childList: true, subtree: true });
})();

```

This script removes the `line-clamp-1` class from the existing `<div>` elements when the page loads and also monitors for any changes in the DOM to remove the class from any newly added `<div>` elements.

## You
Please explain the `while` loop in `removeClassFromDivs`. Can't you use a `for` loop instead?

## ChatGPT
The `getElementsByClassName` function in JavaScript returns a live `HTMLCollection` of found elements. This means that the collection automatically updates itself when the document changes, and it does not create a new static array or list at the time of calling.

The `while` loop in `removeClassFromDivs` exploits this live update feature. It always removes the class from the first element in the collection (`divs[0]`). When this happens, that element is automatically removed from the collection, and every other element shifts down one index. The loop continues until there are no elements left in the collection with the `line-clamp-1` class (i.e., `divs[0]` is `undefined`).

If a `for` loop were used instead, it could lead to issues because the collection is live. For instance, if you iterated from 0 to the collection's length and removed the class in each iteration, you might skip elements. When an element's class is removed and it leaves the collection, the other elements shift down to fill the gap. If the loop then moves on to the next index, it effectively skips the element that moved into the gap.

Here is a simplified example to illustrate the problem:

```javascript
// Imagine these are div elements with the 'line-clamp-1' class
let divs = ['div1', 'div2', 'div3'];

for (let i = 0; i < divs.length; i++) {
    // This is like removing the class and the div leaving the collection
    divs.splice(i, 1);
}

console.log(divs); // Outputs: ['div2']

```

In this example, the `for` loop only removes 'div1' and 'div3'. It skips 'div2' because after 'div1' is removed, 'div2' moves down to fill the gap, and the loop then moves on to the next index.

By contrast, the `while` loop method correctly removes the class from all div elements, as it always operates on the first element of the live collection.

How can I write a multi-line `@description` in the userscript?

## ChatGPT
In Tampermonkey and other userscript managers, metadata block tags like `@description` don't support multi-line values. However, you can make your description text appear as multi-line by using `\n` to create a new line. Note that this doesn't actually create a new line in the userscript metadata block itself, but it will appear as multi-line in places where the description is displayed by the userscript manager.

Here's an example:

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Remove line-clamp-1 class from div elements on perplexity.ai
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      0.1
// @description  This script removes the line-clamp-1 class from div elements.\nNew divs added dynamically will also have the class removed.
// @author       You
// @match        https://www.perplexity.ai/*
// @grant        none
// ==/UserScript==

```

In the description above, the `\n` creates a new line, so it will be displayed as:

```kotlin
This script removes the line-clamp-1 class from div elements.
New divs added dynamically will also have the class removed.

```

Please note that the support for `\n` may vary across different userscript managers and versions. Some might not recognize the `\n` as a newline character and might instead display it as a literal.
